## Usage
    python main.py
 
## Warning
The therapist and philosopher endpoint also use OpenAI GPT-3 to generate the response. Although I have engineered the prompts aiming to generate safe content, it is not guaranteed. GPT-3 is not designed for nor capable to do therapy and philosophy consulting. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**, and never make your instance accesible by the public as this may violate OpenAI's code of conduct and can be very harmful.
